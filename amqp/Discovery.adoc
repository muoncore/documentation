# Building a Discovery using AMQP

## Specifications

The functional tests for this are at

They assume that you have an AMQP server running on localhost (or bound to localhost if running in a container or VM) with the user ```muon``` that has the password ```microservices```

Like all Protocol Specs, they specify that you will build a service named ```tck``` that implements various capabilities that are then checked by the specs to ensure they are compatible.

To use the specs :
* start your service
* checkout the muon-protocol-specifications project
* run ```./runTck.sh discovery amqp```

This will execute the appropriate tests against your service, via the local AMQP server.

## Protocol

AMQP discovery is implemented by a service sending regular announcement broadcasts. These broadcasts contain a full Muon Discovery structure as is.

## Check 1 - your service announces correctly.

The first check the protocol specs run is that your service correctly announces itself.

To make this pass, your service should send a message to the ```serviceAnnounce``` AMQP exchange. It should repeat this every 3 seconds (or close to).

```
{
  "identifier":"tck",
  "tags":["my-tag","tck-service"],
  "resourceConnections":["amqp://localhost:5672", "http://"],
  "streamConnections":["amqp://localhost:5672"]
}
```

## Check 2 - your service listens to other announcements correctly and caches the results

Muon is generally AP by nature (disregarding the clustered nature of AMQP, this is only one options for Discovery/ transport) and so it is encouraged that local caches of discovery information are built up and maintained over time (with appropriate expiry)

The second check requires that your service listens on the ```serviceAnnounce``` exchange and builds a local cache of the messages, permitting fast lookup of active services.

This check re-uses the 'CQ' style interaction to allow the protocol specs to interrogate the remote service.

It is recommended that you implement this feature, and then begin building the AMQP transport CQ capabilities.

To make this pass, you should provide a Query endpoint at ```/discover``` that returns a list of the serviceAnnounce broadcasts that have been received. Additionally, the list should be trimmed down as the broadcast messages go beyond the TTL, which is 3.5 seconds.
