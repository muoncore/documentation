# Introducing Muon

Muon is an opinionated programming model for building Microservice based systems.

It takes the position that adopting a programming model for Microservices should be a positive choice, and that you shouldn't simply adopt the way that HTTP or a particular messaging system expects you to interact.

It is Event Oriented, Reactive and fully polyglot, enabling you to choose the best language for the particular job and easily integrate into your Microservices system.

It supports multiple network transports, and multiple serialisation/ encoding schemes out of the box with excellent interoperability between languages and runtimes.
