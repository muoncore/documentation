=== Event Sourcing

TODO, link core event sourcing docs.

Apart from the recommended event store, Photon, Muon Java provides an in memory, simplified event store that only implements
 the core ingest and stream functionality of a muon compatible event store. You can read more about it link:InMemEventStore.html[here]

This is most useful during building tests.

=== Event Based Testing

If you adopt the Event system (which requires an event store such as _Photon_), then you will design your system domains
as a set of _Events_, and your business processes as a set of causal relationships between them.
