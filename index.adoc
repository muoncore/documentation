= The MicroserviceUX Toolkit

Microservices have taken the world by storm. There are many ways to build Microservices, however many developers will
reach for HTTP based systems. We believe that this is very limiting.   _There is another way!_

The group of projects, that we group together as *MicroserviceUX*, contains a set of tools, libraries, templates and frameworks for you to build _event based_, highly scalable Microservices
using best practice approaches and above all, a great developer and operations experience.

The curently released projects are :-

* <<muon,Muon>> - A new programming model for microservices. Event based, reactive, polyglot and performant.
* <<photon,Photon>> - A high performance event store with HA, event projections and more.

[[muon]]
== Muon 

Muon is an opinionated programming model for building Microservice based systems. Many systems today either communicate using HTTP, or some other network transport, or require you to use a framework that binds you to a single language and runtime.

Muon takes the position that adopting a programming model for Microservices should be a positive choice, and that you shouldn't simply adopt the way that HTTP or a particular messaging system expects you to interact.

It is Event Oriented, Reactive and fully polyglot, enabling you to choose the best language for the particular job and easily integrate into your Microservices system.

It supports multiple network transports, and multiple serialisation/ encoding schemes out of the box with excellent interoperability between languages and runtimes.

It is designed to be naturally polyglot, and there are currently implementations for Java and NodeJS with Python, Go and .Net under development.

[[photon]]
== Photon

Photon is a high performance event stream store. It enables Muon Microservices to move beyond simple event based communication to add _event sourcing_ as a core feature.

It also has HA, pluggable persistence and the ability to generate run aggregation/ event projection functions written in a variety of languages.
